<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated from National Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China / **UESTC** (电子科技大学 通信抗干扰全国重点实验室) with a master’s degree and from College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University / **HEU** (哈尔滨工程大学 信息与通信工程学院) with a bachelor’s degree, recommended for admission to a master's degree without an entrance exam.

My **research interest** includes Massive MIMO, Wireless Communications, Array Signal Processing, Deep Reinforcement Learning, etc. I have published several papers at the top international journals and conferences.

[Multi-RIS-assisted mmWave MIMO systems exploiting statistical CSI: Ergodic capacity analysis and joint beamforming design](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10980191)

**Hanjie Wu**, Xiantao Cheng

**Project**
- **Overview:** For multi-RIS-assisted mmWave MIMO systems, using the replica method from statistical physics, closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity can be derived based on statistical CSI. With the expressions, a corresponding algorithm has been subsequently developed to optimize the hybrid beamforming and RIS phase shift matrices.
- **Progress:** The derived analytical expressions for ergodic capacity demonstrate high accuracy, and the proposed optimization algorithm exhibits fast convergence. Through beamforming optimization, the ergodic capacity of the multi-RIS-assisted mmWave communication system has been significantly improved.

[Ergodic capacity analysis and resolution optimization for uplink MU-MIMO systems with mixed ADCs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10753490)

**Hanjie Wu**, Youyang Xiang, Xiantao Cheng

**Project**
- **Overview:** For uplink MU-MIMO systems with mixed ADCs, the ergodic capacity for both linear and nonlinear quantization models in mixed ADC systems can be derived for resolution optimization design.
- **Progress:** The derived analytical expressions exhibit high accuracy with significantly lower computational time compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, through appropriate system configuration, the approach can partially compensate for capacity loss due to low-resolution ADCs while substantially reducing system costs.

[Ergodic capacity analysis of uplink MU-MIMO systems with low-resolution ADCs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10327714)

Youyang Xiang, **Hanjie Wu**, Xiantao Cheng

**Project**
- **Overview:** For nonlinear quantization models under low-resolution uniform ADCs, the replica method from statistical physics is employed to derive closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity and conduct performance analysis.
- **Progress:** Compared with Monte Carlo simulations, analytical expressions have higher accuracy and greatly save computation time. Moreover, it is demonstrated that with proper system configuration, the performance loss from employing low-resolution ADCs can be negligible compared to that of infinite-precision ADCs.
